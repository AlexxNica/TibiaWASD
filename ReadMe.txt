TibiaWASD 2.4 by Stiju.
www.stiju.com

This new and updated version of TibiaWASD is still in alpha state and hasn't 
been tested very much. The functionality should be mostly the same as earlier
versions, just a few small differences. There might also be some bugs.

New features that has been added is an user interface for keybinding and the 
possibility to manually insert the needed memory addresses for the program.
Double-click on the TibiaWASD icon in traybar to open this window.

There is also an update function, which is a step-by-step memoryscanner that 
will probably work with all Tibia versions since 10.11.

Don't forget to hit the save button after any changes has been made.
