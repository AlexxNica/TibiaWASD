TibiaWASD is a must have tool for Tibia, it fixes the awkward (unless you're a lefty) keyboard layout by replacing it with a fully working WASD layout.

While TibiaWASD is active there's two different modes, default walking used to walk around (duh) and then we've the WriteMode which is used to be able to write messages. 
To access WriteMode just press Y button and to exit you press Escape or Return/Enter which will also send the message.

There's also mapping for the number keys 1,2,3... 0 to the respective function keys F1,F2,F3... F10 so your hotkeys are a little bit closer.
And if your mouse has extra buttons, commonly known as Mousebutton 3,4 and 5, they're also mapped to F10,F11 and F12 by default.

TibiaWASD is giving the users almost full control to customize the mapping for all keys themselves by using the settings window. 
Which can be accessed by double-clicking the TibiaWASD icon in the traybar (small icons near the clock).

Inside the settings window you'll find ActionState address that's used by TibiaWASD to know when to automatically switch over to WriteMode inside menus and other ingame windows, gives a smoother experience.

The ActionState field can be manually set or set by the Update function, which is a step-by-step memoryscanner that currenty works with all Tibia clients since version 7.8.

By checking the Version Independent setting in the settings window, TibiaWASD will probably work for all Tibia clients version 7.0 and above.
